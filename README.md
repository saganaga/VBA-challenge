# VBA-challenge
Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge

The goal of this project is to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- [ ] The ticker symbol.

- [ ] Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- [ ] The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- [ ] The total stock volume of the stock.

- [ ] **Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Data Files
The project includes two Excel Workbooks. The larger one called Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx is the final data set. The other alphabetical_testing.xlsx is shorter and is meant for trial runs during development.
